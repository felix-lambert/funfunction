// Functions are closures
// closures are functions that are defined outside the variable

// Closures are useful because they let you associate some 
// data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data. 
// This has obvious parallels to object oriented programming, where objects allow us 
// to associate some data (the object's properties) with one or more methods.
// Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. 
// Much of the code we write in front-end JavaScript is event-based â€” we define 
// some behavior, then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a 
// click or a keypress). Our code is generally attached as a callback: a single function 
// which is executed in response to the event.
